## About 
TextExerciser, TE for short, is a dynamic testing platform with ability to adaptively generate text input, dedicated to improving the coverage of dynamic testing of Android apps to detect more software defects. TE was originally a research project of Fudan University whose goal was to generate text input in dynamic analysis of Android app. At present, we have developed a complete dynamic testing tool based on the text input generation module. We hope this project can help other researchers or practitioners. Feel free to [contact](#contact-link) us if you have any question or issue.
