### Find a privacy leak by traffic analysis
This is a typical demo of a privacy leakage defect. 
In *G Cloud* app, user credentials will be sent by HTTP without encryption. In order to trigger such privacy leakage behavior, it is neccessary to generate text inputs to meet the verification such as the length verification for password and the match between the password and the confirmed password. Besides, in order to better display, only the sensitive traffic found in *Burpsuit* is shown in video. In practice, we achieve this by filtering the traffic using the recorded generated text inputs as keywords.
