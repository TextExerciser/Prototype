### TextExerciser WorkFlow
TextExerciser provides a platform for dynamic testing, which automatically drives the operation of Android apps, automatically generates text inputs for apps, and detects software defects during dynamic testing. The workflow of our methodology as follow :
<img src="/Prototype/pics/aov.svg">
* Driver : An automated UI exploration module that can analyze the UI, extract elements, and send events to drive the execution of the app, as the basic module of the dynamic test platform. Specifically, We implement a UI state transition diagram, use depth-first as the exploration strategy, and deal with special circumstances such as permission popups and jumping out of app. 
* Input Generator : An iterative, feedback-driven text input generator, which can extract constraints from texts on UI and automatically generate text input. You can see more details in the next section.
* Traffic analysis : In this module, we collect the traffic of the app during the dynamic testing, and use a keyword-based method to find the privacy leakage problem in tested app. Specifically, TextExerciser will record the generated text inputs during the testing, and then use the generated text inputs as the keywords to filter the traffic to discover the sensitive information leaks in the app.
