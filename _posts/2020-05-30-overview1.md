### TextExerciser WorkFlow
TextExerciser provides a platform for dynamic testing, which automatically drives the operation of Android apps, automatically generate the text input in the apps, and supports the defect detection modules. The workflow of our methodology is as follow :
<img src="/Prototype/pics/w1.svg">
* Driver : An automated UI exploration module that can analyze the UI, extract elements, and send events to drive the execution of the app, as the basic module of the dynamic test platform. Specifically, We implement a UI state transition diagram, use depth-first as the exploration strategy, and deal with special circumstances such as permission popups and jumping out of app. 
* Input Generator : An iterative, feedback-driven text input generator, which can extract constraints from texts on UI and automatically generate text input. You can see more details in the next section.
* Traffic analysis : In this module, we collect the traffic of the app during the dynamic testing, and use a keyword-based method to find the privacy leakage problem in the app. Specifically, TextExerciser will record the generated text input during the testing, and then use the generated text input as the keyword to filter the traffic to discover the sensitive information protection defects in the app.
